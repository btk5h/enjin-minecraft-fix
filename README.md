# enjin-minecraft-fix
Enjin support for Minecraft 1.8 sucks. This Chrome extension fixes that by displaying user skins with 1.8 layers.

## How does it work?
Enjin convenient marks its avatars with the `minecraft-model` class and uses the `data-name` attribute to store the username. This extension replaces those avatars using [Crafatar](https://crafatar.com/)'s awesome skin rendering service.
